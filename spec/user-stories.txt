My breakable toy is going to be a survey app for Tech Collective to use at their Grrl Tech event.  They have all the teachers and students take a survey at the end of the program, so this will simplify the process and give them a reusable tool.  Ideally it will have the ability to export the data but this is the bare bones version.
